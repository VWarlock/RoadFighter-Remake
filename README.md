###Road Fighter - remake of MSX game by Brain Games.###

In 2003 the people from [Retro Remakes](http://www.remakes.org/) organized a [remake competition](http://www.retroremakes.com/comp2003/results.php)
for the first time. The idea was to create a remake from scratch in a short amount of time.
We decided to participate with a remake of the MSX game [Road Fighter](http://www.generation-msx.nl/msxdb/softwareinfo/684):
a simple racing game that would be doable before the deadline and still be fun to play (oh the nostalgia!).

In the end we met the deadline (barely!) and sent in our entry. When finally the results came in, we
finished 7th out the 83 entries. Not too bad for a 2 month project :)
